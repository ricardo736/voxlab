## 🎯 FINAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Fix #13: AI Audio Input
**Status:** Intentionally not implemented  
**Reason:** Text-based approach is more effective  
**Documentation:** Created comprehensive notes explaining decision  
**Alternative:** Current text input works better for user needs  
**Future:** Can be added if user demand justifies effort

### Fix #14: Reference Singers Quality ⭐ IMPROVED
**Problem:** Need better singer examples with gender balance  
**Solution:** Enhanced AI prompt with specific requirements  
**Improvements:**
- Now requests 3-4 singers (was 2)
- Requires gender balance (1-2 male, 1-2 female)
- Emphasizes internationally recognized artists
- Prioritizes vocal quality and range similarity
- Natural mixing (no gender segregation)
**Example Output:** ["Adele", "Sam Smith", "Christina Aguilera", "John Legend"]  
**Impact:** Better, more diverse reference examples
